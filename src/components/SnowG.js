              <h4>The Original SnowG</h4>
              <p>
                In 2004, I sold everything I owned and moved to Colorado. I joined Winter Park Resorts Lift Operations team and chose to utilize their employee
                housing offerings as my place of residence. I was randomly placed with 3 other roommates. One of them was this crazy kid my age name Alika from Colorado
                Springs. After over a decade of adventures in December of 2018 I joined the team for his brand SnowG Streetwear as their web development and digital marketing specialist.
               </p>
               <p>
                 The application is a mobile focused synopsis of SnowG as a brand utilizing HTML/CSS/Firebase to better provide traffic to our retail site
                 and social media platforms.
               </p>
               <p>
                Moving into 2019 we plan to expand the brand's product offerings and social media platform presence. As for our website we are currently moving from 
                HTML/CSS to a React/ReactNative version as well as incorporate our own store and payment systems to better serve our growing customer base.
